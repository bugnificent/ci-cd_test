Alert: Cross-Domain Misconfiguration
Risk: Medium
Confidence: Medium
Description: Web browser data loading may be possible, due to a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner (using IP address white-listing, for instance).
Configure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely, to allow the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive manner.
